# Project folder and app.py

In this folder, I added app.py, a Python application that ensures smooth transition between individual pages while preserving the uniform look of the website. The application uses Flask to load a base HTML and a base CSS and plugs in our individual contents. The base HTML consists of a navigation bar and a footer, please don't overwrite this in your individual pages. 

If you want to try it out and open the webpage, run this script.
