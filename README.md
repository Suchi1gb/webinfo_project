# Project folder and app.py

In the project_improved folder, I added app.py, a Python application that ensures smooth transition between individual pages while preserving the uniform look of the website. The application uses Flask to load a base HTML and a base CSS and plugs in our individual contents. The base HTML consists of a navigation bar and a footer, please don't overwrite this in your individual pages. Feel free to modify the base CSS stylesheet to your preference.

If you want to try it out and open the webpage, pip install flask then run this script (you can open the server from the link appearing in the terminal).
